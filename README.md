# Alperen Erkan

This page is intentionally sparse.

Not because there is little to say,  
but because most of it does not need to be said.

---

## Orientation

I work at the layer where software stops being forgiving.

Where undefined behavior is not a concept,  
but a consequence.

Where failures are not exceptions,  
but signals.

---

## What I Care About

- Systems that remain understandable under stress
- Boundaries: privilege, memory, time, trust
- Behavior under failure, not success
- Simplicity that survives scale
- Code that explains itself when things go wrong

---

## Experience (Context, not Credentials)

I have contributed to systems and research efforts  
in environments where mistakes are expensive.

- HAVELSAN  
- ASELSAN  
- NASA  
- MIT  
- European Space Agency  

Names matter less than constraints.

## Security Perspective

Security is not a feature.  
It is an emergent property of correct assumptions.

Most incidents do not happen because code is complex,  
but because it is trusted for the wrong reasons.

---

## On Abstractions

Abstractions are useful.  
Until they hide cost, state, or authority.

When that happens,  
they become liabilities.

---

## Closing Note

I do not optimize for visibility.  
I optimize for understanding.

If something here feels unfinished,  
it probably is.

That is deliberate.
